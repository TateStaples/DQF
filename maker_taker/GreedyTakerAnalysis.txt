Playing the game as a maker against the Greedy Taker, what are the advantages of each role?
The taker has an advantage because he starts with the most information. The maker has the advantage of a ten wide profit window and the ability to learn where the true value of the case is.

What do you think is the best possible strategy for the Maker?
If the Maker knows that the taker is greedy, the maker should try to force a scenario where by the third round, they know a window that contains the true value. Then they max out sizing and win lots of money.
An example of this strategy would be start with a 70-80 market (size 1). Depending on there bet, shift your market 10 in that direction (size 1).
If the buy/sell changes then you know that they are inbetween your two markets, if they buy twice, you know its 90-100. In either of these scenarios, max out your sizing and make bank.
If they sell twice, you don't know the range so just lower the market to like 25-30 (size 1) to minimize losses.


How much do you think the Maker profits or loses per game on average?

For values 65->100 you average 2.5 [mean dis from target] * 1000 [max size] - ~10[approximate average distance on prior guesses]
For values under 65 you lose ~3 [num markets] * ~35 [guessed average miss]

The gives a rough expectation estimate of $760 per round. Most rounds you will lose money, but when you do find their range you make a lot.
