Part 4 (OPTIONAL): General Maker and Taker Strategy
Assume now we have 100 players, and each submits both a Maker and a Taker.
Each person’s Maker plays the game once against each other person’s Taker and vice versa (We are no longer playing against Greedy Taker).
Each Maker and Taker’s score is the sum of the pnl against the 99 other players and the Makers and Takers are scored separately.
What Maker and Taker would you submit and why? (Don’t spend too much time on this!
The strategy for this game can go very deep and a solution that doesn’t require a lot of time to implement yet does reasonable things is good enough)
-------------------------------
I would probably as maker just use a simple binary search (ie 50 -> 75 -> 87.5) and keep sizing at a minimum to reduce my losses.
The maker a serious advantage in this game so upping the sizing is negative EV.

For the Maker I would lie (take lower EV option) 90% on the first round and take the higher EV round 2/3. That would make me unpredictable to most easily written makers and have fairly high EV.
Given longer term, I might further investigate using CFR to discover GTO strat.
