# Duke Quantitative Finance Club - Projects Repository
Welcome to my repository for projects with the Duke Quantitative Finance Club! I am a proud member of this club and am thrilled to be sharing my work with the community.

This repository contains all of my projects that I have completed or am currently working on as part of the Duke Quantitative Finance Club. Each project is its own folder and includes the code, data, and any additional files needed to complete the project.

I hope that this repository serves as a source of inspiration and knowledge for others who are interested in finance and data science.

## Projects:
- Market Maker game strategy discussion
- Market prediction
- TSLA bot
